# Speech-Based Search Engine

This Python project allows users to perform Google searches using voice commands. It utilizes the `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` libraries for speech input and text-to-speech output, respectively.

## Features

* Accepts voice input through the microphone
* Converts speech to text using Google's speech recognition API
* Opens the search results in a web browser
* Provides audio feedback using text-to-speech

## Requirements

Install the following Python libraries before running the script:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
```

> Note: On some systems, you may need to install `PyAudio` separately due to compilation requirements.

## How to Use

1. Connect a microphone to your computer.
2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python speech\ based\ search\ engine.py
```

3. Speak your query when prompted.
4. The program will search Google and open the results in your default web browser.

## Files

* `speech based search engine.py`: Main script containing all functionality.

## Limitations

* Requires a stable internet connection for speech recognition.
* May not accurately recognize accents or noisy background environments.
